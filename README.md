# ðŸŽµ Audio Frequency & Brightness Analysis

This project analyzes and compares multiple audio tracks based on their **average frequency content** and **spectral brightness (centroid)**. It leverages `librosa`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib` to extract interpretable audio features and visualize them.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… RMS loudness normalization for fair comparison  
- âœ… Spectrogram-based average power computation  
- âœ… Spectral centroid calculation as a brightness score  
- âœ… Frequency vs. power line chart with per-track labeling  
- âœ… Printed brightness (centroid) ranking for all tracks

## ðŸ“Š Sample Output

- A matplotlib chart comparing each songâ€™s average frequency content  
- Spectral brightness (in Hz) shown in the legend  
- Sorted brightness summary printed to console
